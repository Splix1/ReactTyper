# ReactTyper is an authentic combination of [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com/) and [10FastFingers](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english).

### Both have their differences such as TypeRacer being a live WPM test using real sentences/paragraphs including punctuation/capitalization where you can not continue unless you type the text correctly and allowing you to race others, while 10FastFingers intends to be a sprint using random words with no punctuation/capitlization and allowing mistakes.

#### ReactTyper is a platform intended to give you multiple options to test your speed whether you want to perform a sprint allowing mistakes or use a real-world text sample that requires accuracy for completion. ReactTyper also allows you to race others in both sections to see who can finish first, or who can type more.
