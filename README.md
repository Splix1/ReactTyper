# [ReactTyper](https://reacttyper.herokuapp.com/) is an authentic combination of [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com/) and [10FastFingers](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english).

### Both have their differences such as TypeRacer being a live WPM test using real sentences/paragraphs including punctuation/capitalization where you can not continue unless you type the text correctly and allowing you to race others, while 10FastFingers intends to be a sprint using random words with no punctuation/capitlization and allowing mistakes.

#### ReactTyper is a platform aiming to give you multiple options to test your speed and reaction time whether you want to perform a sprint allowing mistakes or use a real-world text sample that requires accuracy for completion.

### ReactTyper will in time provide the following game modes:

- Single/Multiplayer Sprint (30 second sprint of random words with no punctuation/capitalization)
- Single/Multiplayer Race (timed completion of a set of text containing punctuation/capitalization)
- Single/Multiplayer React Sprint (similar to sprint, but you're only given one word at a time, preventing you from reading ahead)
- Single/Multiplayer React Race (similar to race, but you're only given one word at a time)
- Single/Multiplayer Marathon (similar to sprint, but you have a health bar that goes down for each wrong word and the game ends when your health reaches 0)

### ReactTyper will also include user authentication to allow dynamically tracking user stats including a leaderboard showing the highest scores for each mode.
